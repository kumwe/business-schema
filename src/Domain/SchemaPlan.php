/**
 * One approvable, executable migration of a business definition's physical schema on one site.
 *
 * A plan is the unit the whole schema pipeline is built around: the planner compiles the difference between
 * two definition versions into an ordered set of `SchemaOperation` steps, an administrator approves that
 * exact content, and only then may an executor run DDL. Everything needed to make those three stages safe
 * across processes lives here — the definition versions and checksums the plan moves between, the physical
 * schema checksum it expects to find and the one it must arrive at, the approval evidence, the recovery
 * evidence a locking or destructive plan requires, the monotonic execution fence, and the recorded outcome.
 *
 * The plan is immutable and content addressed. `checksum()` covers the operations and the bindings but not
 * the lifecycle state, so re-planning invalidates an existing approval while a status change does not; the
 * constructor refuses an approval whose checksum is not this plan's. Every transition returns a new instance
 * with an incremented revision, and the constructor re-proves the whole state machine, so a plan loaded from
 * the database cannot carry an evidence combination the transitions would never have produced.
