 * Signals that a business-schema document breaks a rule this namespace enforces.
 *
 * Blueprints, plans, steps, and recovery evidence all validate themselves as they are constructed and
 * are all rebuilt from untrusted arrays through `SchemaDocument`, so the whole namespace raises this
 * one type: an importer, a repository hydrating a row, or a delivery adapter has a single class to
 * catch whichever field, identifier, checksum, or portability rule was broken. It extends
 * `InvalidArgumentException` because a rejected document is bad input rather than a broken
 * installation, which is what lets `BusinessApiResponder` answer it with 422 instead of a fault.
 * Messages name the rule that failed and stay operator-facing.
